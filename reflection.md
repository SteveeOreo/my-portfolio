Reflection on AI in My Portfolio Website Build Process

Building my portfolio website with the support of AI inside Zed has been both eye-opening and transformative. It was my first time integrating AI deeply into a creative and technical process, and the experience revealed how powerful, but also limited, AI can be when paired with intentional human direction.

One of the areas that worked especially well was scaffolding components and layouts. Using AI to quickly generate boilerplate code for the Navbar, Hero section, and skill cards saved me significant time. Normally, setting up structure and responsive design can feel repetitive, but with AI prompts, I was able to spin up solid starting points in minutes. This allowed me to focus on customization and design polish rather than boilerplate coding. For example, when I asked AI to create a responsive project card styled with TailwindCSS, it not only scaffolded the JSX but also suggested hover states, border utilities, and transitions that made the UI feel professional out of the box.

AI also proved invaluable when I ran into debugging roadblocks. A great example was when Tailwind’s @apply directive threw an error in my CSS. I could paste the error into Zed’s AI assistant and quickly get an explanation of why group couldn’t be applied in that context, along with alternative approaches. This saved me from hours of trial-and-error and deep-diving into documentation.

However, AI also exposed some limitations. While it excels at generating first drafts, it sometimes produced code that was either slightly outdated, not aligned with my exact Tailwind configuration, or overengineered for what I needed. For instance, it occasionally added unnecessary props or utilities, which made me stop and prune the output. I realized that while AI can accelerate the process, it is not a “copy-paste” solution—human review and intentional iteration are always required.

The most important lesson I learned was about prompting. At the beginning, my prompts were vague (“Build a Navbar for my portfolio”), and the results felt generic. But as I became more specific—adding my preferences for colors, chess-inspired design elements, animations, and responsive breakpoints—the quality of the outputs improved dramatically. I discovered that prompting is like giving creative direction to a junior developer: the clearer the instructions, the closer the result matches your vision.

Reviewing and iterating with AI was also a learning process. Zed’s integration allowed me to treat AI like a pair-programming partner. I would generate an initial draft, review it carefully, ask for improvements (“simplify this state logic” or “make the hover animation more subtle”), and then iterate. This back-and-forth gave me confidence that I wasn’t just relying blindly on AI but actively shaping the output to match my style.

Ultimately, AI helped me merge my business background with my new front-end developer skills into a portfolio that feels professional, personal, and efficient to build. I walked away with the understanding that AI is not meant to replace my creativity or problem-solving, but to amplify them—speeding up repetitive tasks, offering guidance, and freeing me to focus on design, storytelling, and polish.

This experience reinforced that AI works best when treated as a collaborator, not a crutch. The project taught me patience in prompting, diligence in reviewing, and confidence in iterating until the portfolio reflected not just my technical skills, but also my personality and passions, including my love for chess.
