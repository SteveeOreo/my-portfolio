                    My journey began with the simple satisfaction of buying and reselling consumable products as a kid,
                    which continued developing as I grew up. This led me to study and ultimately earn a Bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurship Studies & AgriBusiness. 
                    During this time, I built a solid foundation in business operations, financial principles, and strategic thinking. 
                    After graduation, I served as a Personal Assistant to the Director of Administration at the Ministry of Public Utilities & Water Resources. 
                    In this role, I enhanced my organizational, communication, and leadership skills, learning to manage priorities, streamline processes, and support high-level decision-making.

                  <p className="text-sm">
                    While excelling in administration, my curiosity about technology kept growing. I wanted to do more than just manage systems; I wanted to build them. 
                    This desire prompted my transition into tech through ALX Africa's Front-End Software Engineering program. Through months of hands-on training, I mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and TailwindCSS, gaining experience working in agile development teams.

                   Most recently, I completed the AI for Developers program, where I explored how artificial intelligence can help developers create smarter, more efficient applications. Today, I combine my business knowledge, administrative experience, and technical skills to develop impactful digital solutions.

                   My goal is to create platforms that enhance access, efficiency, and opportunities, especially in agriculture, e-commerce, and education for small-scale farmers.
                   For me, coding is more than just writing lines of code; it's about solving real-world problems, one project at a time.
